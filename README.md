## TODO

* Countdown days till 420, maybe day count grows as it gets closer???
* Google feedback form
* Toss out images that are below a certain size threshold
* Instead of image pulling every 2.5, it should change every 2.5
* Organize RIP, ct? (methods)
* Texts stay at top
* Ditch background shading, get color palette
* Smooth textbox size transitions
* Specifically defined exclusion list for url strings
* text background color changes?
* jumble also changes color!  // replace self.options.jumbleColor
	with pulling one color from array of possible colors
* No repeated words
* Glow on mouseover
